>## Usage

The navigation bar provides links to different pages:
  - **Portfolio** - carousel of various projects I have built.  It is a grab-and-drag component.
  - **Resume** - brief summary of my skills and history, and a button to download a pdf version of my full resume.
  - **Contact** - my professional contact information.
  - **Fun Stuff** - dropdown menu of various fun components.

The navigation bar will collapse into a button on small screens, but with all the same options.

Lastly, the Footer has links to my different professional accounts including: LinkedIn, GitHub, and a professional Instagram page.
